# HR-Analytics-Dashboard
Hello !
I am glad to share that I have successfully created a Tableau Dashboard Project which is named as HR Analytics Dashboard.
In this report, I'm sharing my insights on Attrition at a particular company and adding some other details of employees which would be helpful for the Management of the company to take required decisions in future for the betterment of the company and its employees.
I've strengthened my skills while doing this project such as:
1) Full and proper understanding of raw data given.
2) Data cleaning and ETL process.
3) Created Calculated Field .
4) Created dashboard using different visuals.
5) Getting insights of the whole employees structure in the company.
I have created charts like BAR-IN-BAR Chart, Donut Chart, Bar Graphs, Tree map, Text table Chart for better understanding of Data.
